# Instructions

Greetings, esteemed developer!

Congratulations on reaching this momentous milestone! You've overcome numerous challenges to arrive at this point, and we commend you for your dedication and hard work.

However, we must caution you, dear developer: the task at hand is not for the faint of heart.
This time, you will be designing a full agency landing page, which presents its own set of unique challenges.

Unlike previous projects, we will only provide the desktop design.
You will have to rely on your creativity and expertise to craft a responsive mobile design that meets our high standards.

We have every confidence that you will exceed our expectations and deliver a truly exceptional result.
We wish you the best of luck in this exciting endeavor!

## Follow these instructions to have the best experience:

### 1 - Setting up the GitHub Repo:

To begin working on your own repository, the first step is to remove the .git folder `rm -rf .git`.
Then, create a new repository on GitHub and initialize it by running the command `git init` in your local project directory.
Add all files to the staging area using `git add .` and create your first commit with `git commit -m 'My first commit'`.
After completing these steps, you can add the remote origin to your repository by running `git remote add origin 'link of your repository'`.
Finally, push your first commit to the remote origin with `git push origin master`.

### 2 - Working on the project:

The project is located on the `./src` directory and all the necessary assets can be found on the
`./src/assets` directory.
